  text: "The paramedic says:\n\n\u201CWe have a 43 year-old male with no past medical
    history who was just involved in an altercation at a bar in which he was stabbed
    multiple times in the chest and abdomen. On our arrival, he was a GCS of 14 with
    mild confusion, intoxicated and there was a bunch of blood found at the scene.
    We were only able to get a 20 gauge IV in his left AC started him on fluid for
    hypotension in the field. We put an occlusive dressing on the left chest wound.
    He has been able to protect his airway so far so we didn\u2019t intubate him.
    He got 50 micrograms of fentanyl for pain on the way in. That\u2019s all we got.\u201D\n\n<
